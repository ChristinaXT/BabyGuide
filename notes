My son's first birthday party is coming up in August and I thought
it would be fun to create an app that allows for me to write out my
ideas for the party on a list with help requests from my friends
and family. Then they could go onto the app and sign up and choose to select
any requests they want to help with.  everyone should be able to see the list
of requests, who is helping with them and which ones still need help on.
